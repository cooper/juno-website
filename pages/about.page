    sec [what is this] {
        juno is a seriously modern IRC daemon. it is designed to be ridiculously
        extensible, painlessly reloadable, and excessively configurable.
        	
        while learning Perl, I discovered pIRCd. I added a few more features to
        it but created more bugs and memory leaks than features. I decided to
        start over from scratch because if I wrote it myself I would understand
        more how to modify it and work around the issues that I had when I was
        working on the perl IRC daemon that Jay Kominek wrote 13 years prior.
        juno is written from scratch, [[multiple times over | doc/history ]].
        however, the current codebase dates back to 2011.
        	
        juno has a lot of features that other IRCds written in compiled
        languages cannot offer, such as upgrading without restarting and an
        extremely versatile module interface.

    sec [why does this exist] {
        Perl is the right language for IRC. IRC is chock full of various strings
        and other what not, all of which is easily parsed by Perl, where the C
        IRC daemons jump through all kinds of hoops and have really nasty looking
        code (have you ever looked at the Undernet IRC daemon?) Whereas this is,
        in my opinion, very clean.
    }
       
    sec [how to get this] {
        juno stable release can be downloaded from
        [[here | https://github.com/cooper/juno/releases/latest]].
        
        You can also clone the git repository and then checkout the release you
        want. In fact, this is preferred since juno offers easy upgrading from
        the repository.
           
        Development can be found on [[github | https://github.com/cooper/juno]].
